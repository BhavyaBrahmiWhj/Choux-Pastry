Choux is a multi-purpose "paste" that hovers somewhere between dough and batter. It's made by cooking flour with water and/or .
milk and butter, then mixing in eggs off heat to form a pipe-able, spoonable consistency. It's then cooked a second time, either 
by baking, frying, or poaching, depending on the specific recipe the choux is being used for
Unlike typical batters, choux is thick enough to hold its shape without spreading out flat like a pancake or needing a vessel to 
contain it, like a Yorkshire pudding. Unlike your average dough, though, it’s thin enough to pipe by hand into a wide variety of 
fun shapes and sizes (think puffs, tubes, rings, and more). This rare combination of traits helps explain choux’s unique value 
proposition in the pastry world.
